# aps-15-Kattis-Solutions
a place for us to keep our solutions to the Kattis problems given by our professor

So I was thinking that people could simply make a folder for their given solution and put their files inthere. 
Rather than replacing the previously fastest solution, just put yours next to it :D 
You can name your solution-folder with your name and the Kattis-stated runtime. Or you can put it in a seperate file. Or you can avoid including your name if you prefer. But it would be neat if it was easy to spot the runtime. And it would be extra neat with a description of why your solution is extra clever!
Readable code and comments are encouraged but not enforced.
