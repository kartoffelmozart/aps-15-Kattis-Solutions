# aps-15-Kattis-Solutions
a place for us to keep our solutions to the Kattis problems given by our professor

So I was thinking that people could simply make a folder for their given solution and put their files inthere. 
Rather than replacing the previously fastest solution, just put yours next to it :D Also kindly include a text file with the Kattis-stated runtime so we can keep track of which one is fastest! also you can put your name in there for the braggin rights and whatnot.
